Server files here are meant for the public, a person or a community wanting to host their own Dayz Overwatch server. If you’re a server company and wish to host and offer dayz Overwatch to your customers then I would ask you to contact me on scrumbee@scrumbee.net for more information regarding this.
This is based on Reality server pack from thevisad so I would like to thank him for his awesome work.
I would also like to thank everyone over at opendayz.net for awesome ideas and information.
I would also like to thank the dayzmod.com team for their awesome work.
You can find all information you need about the mod at www.dayzoverwatch.com
I would like that you do not use the word "Official" when you name your server, simply to fact that its misleading
to the players, and since this is a public released I have no control over what custom content gets put on your private servers
 which might degrade the servers and represent the mod in a way that wasn’t intended, besides that one restriction
feel free to name it whatever you want.
0.2.4 - You now have 4 diffrent server files:

@DayzOverwatch_Server - Regular Dayz Overwatch
@DayzOverwatch_Server-killmsg - Regular Dayz Overwatch with killmsg
@DayzOverwatch_Server-invcust - Custom inventory
@DayzOverwatch_Server-invcust-killmsg - Custom inventory with killmsg
